== Concrete Table Inheritance ==
Client -> Service: requestObject{requestDetails}

activate Service
Service -> DB: saveRequest(requestObject)

DB -> VRT: save {vaccineRecipientDetails}
else HealthCareProvider Object
DB -> HCPT: save {healthCareProviderDetails}
else Admin Object
DB -> AT: save {adminDetails}
note right: this flow does not happen in reality since there \nis only one (already created) Administrator
